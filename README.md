# Assets for BUSMALL Lab

## Lab 11

=======

Encoded in javascript voting on products by clicking pictures.

This was done by referencing a document in html page as well as putting place holders for 3 images on the html page to link from the javascript page.

Then created a [constructor function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes/constructor), with properties that are related to viewing the pictures, counting votes and views as well.

But then we need to instantiate the images/products so the constructor can grab those through the paramaters.

The images were then put into a random generator function to ensure everytime the site refreshes, you wouldn't see the same line of pictures.

Then I created an event handler to listen to the clicks and counts to 25 clicks. Once that happens, you can click on `show results` and the results of how many times something was viewed and voted on.

------------

## Lab 12

Created a bar chart that will appear after the voting has concluded. The bar chart reflects views and voting.

------------

## Lab 15b

Deploying site and submit for final submission. I ran through the site one more time to ensure no bugs or gitchas.

## **Lab 11**

=======

This went pretty well, it's incredible to me what had actually stuck in my head vs. what I had to look up. It's definitely not all there, and the terms are not there yet. But I am getting quicker at building, and calling out the terms is just right around the corner.
CSS is definitely something I am working on still, an ongoing battle. Also, how to think through javascript on what functions would be best. I have to get into the practice of what questions to ask in order to get the best outcome for what the customer wants.
this took me around 4.5 to 5 hours. I expected it to take around that.
It's really the CSS that takes me a bit haha, so many options to choose how to build the website! Probably easier once you have the site in mind.

## **Lab 12**

This went really well overall. Had to reference the demo code because the graph and votes didn't show up after 'clicking' to vote. Turned out I had mislabeled the current product array of views while pushing into the new productViews Array. And I had 'Obj' in 'chartObj' lowercased in the parameters of the DOM reference & object. I ALMOST was going down the whole of 'what function am I not calling back' or 'what am I missing in this function', and then I started checking brackets and spelling line by line, of what I recently added.

This took me about 1.5 to 2 hours. I thought it would take me about that. Again, the CSS takes up the most, stylizing. I'm getting better at googling things for CSS though to get what I want the site to look like though.

## **Lab15b**

This was an excellent lab that tested and added some variety to my skillset. I love graphs and I really enjoyed going through and tweaking the graph to see what else could be done.

For final submission, this took me less than 15 minutes. About what I expected.

# Assets for BUSMALL Lab

Encoded in javascript voting on products by clicking pictures.

This was done by referencing a document in html page as well as putting place holders for 3 images on the html page to link from the javascript page.

Then created a [constructor function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes/constructor), with properties that are related to viewing the pictures, counting votes and views as well.

But then we need to instantiate the images/products so the constructor can grab those through the paramaters.

The images were then put into a random generator function to ensure everytime the site refreshes, you wouldn't see the same line of pictures.

Then I created an event handler to listen to the clicks and counts to 25 clicks. Once that happens, you can click on `show results` and the results of how many times something was viewed and voted on.

> ## Reflections and Comments

This went pretty well, it's incredible to me what had actually stuck in my head vs. what I had to look up. It's definitely not all there, and the terms are not there yet. But I am getting quicker at building, and calling out the terms is just right around the corner.
CSS is definitely something I am working on still, an ongoing battle. Also, how to think through javascript on what functions would be best. I have to get into the practice of what questions to ask in order to get the best outcome for what the customer wants.
this took me around 4.5 to 5 hours. I expected it to take around that.
It's really the CSS that takes me a bit haha, so many options to choose how to build the website! Probably easier once you have the site in mind.
